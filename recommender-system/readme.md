2 Types of recommender systems are 
* Content-Based -->determine how similar a pair of items are based on their metadata tags
* Collaborative Filtering --> recommend new items based on the actions of users

Content based recommender systems use the features of items to recommend other similar items. For example, if Iâ€™m browsing for solid colored t-shirts on Amazon, a content based recommender might recommend me other t-shirts or solid colored sweatshirts because they have similar features (sleeves, single color, shirt, etc.).

CF can be divided into 
* Model-Based Collaborative filtering -->performed by different machine learning algorithms
* Neighbourhood/Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering 
	1.User based -->Users who are similar to you also liked
	Similarity values are measured by observing all the items rated by users.
	2.Item based -->Users who liked this item also liked
	Similarity values are measured by observing all the users who have rated items.

User based -->create a user-item matrix
Item Based -->create a item-user matrix
